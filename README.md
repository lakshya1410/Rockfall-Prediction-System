  - Custom ML models (Random Forest)
  - Hugging Face Transformer models
  - Automated hyperparameter optimization

- **ðŸ“Š Data Processing**
  - Real-time weather data collection
  - Seismic activity monitoring
  - Feature engineering pipeline
  - Time series analysis

- **ðŸ”„ MLOps**
  - Automated model training
  - Model versioning and tracking
  - Performance monitoring
  - A/B testing support

- **ðŸš¨ Alert System**
  - Risk level classification
  - Email notifications
  - SMS alerts
  - Alert throttling

- **ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring**
  - Prometheus metrics
  - Grafana dashboards
  - Model performance tracking
  - System health monitoring
